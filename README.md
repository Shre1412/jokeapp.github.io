# Joke Generator
This React application is designed to display 'Jokes'!

# Features
* The application makes an api call to "https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke". It fetches a random joke along with the punchline which is then displayed onto the screen in a stylised table.
* The application also allows the user to add his own entry into the table of jokes which will be stored onto the local storage along with the random jokes fetched from the api.
* Option for searching through the table to find a particular element is also provided.
* Finally, all these features are linked using react-router-dom using the NavBar.
